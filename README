OpenTorpedo - What is OpenTorpedo?
==================================

OpenTorpedo is a submarine simulation (subsim) which tries to emulate
the behaviour of modern submarines. The player is placed in command
of a submarine and is able to move about in a deep ocean environment.

Combat missions are now being added to OpenTorpedo, and ships with
sonar will run from torpedoes and, if they can detect the player,
will return fire.



Why a subsim?
=============

I've always been a fan of subsims and played commercial games,
but couldn't find a modern subsim for open source operating systems
(such as Linux and FreeBSD). Danger from the Deep is available,
but it's stictly for World War II u-boats, and has relatively high
graphics requirements. Looking around I found a half dozen or so
subsims that had begun and dropped away shortly after beginning development.

The LinuxSSN project had laid a solid foundation before the developers
dropped the project and I decided to pick up where they left off.
The heart of OpenTorpedo comes from their project and attempts to further
their work.

What do I need to build OpenTorpedo?
====================================

To build OpenTorpedo you'll need a C++ compiler (GNU's Compiler Collection
is recommended) and the following development libraries:

SDL
SDL_gfx
SDL_image
SDL_mixer

Assuming the above libraries are installed, it should be possible to
build OpenTorpedo with the following commands

tar zxf OpenTorpedo-1.4.tar.gz
cd OpenTorpedo
make

Once OpenTorpedo has built, an executable file (called OpenTorpedo) will
be placed in the top level directory. From there
the game can be run with the command:

./OpenTorpedo

The following command line parameters are recognized:

-w		Run in windowed mode, this is the default
-f		Run in full screen
-s		Enable sound effects
-v		Display version number and exit
-h		Display help and exit
-m <mission> 	Load a specific mission
