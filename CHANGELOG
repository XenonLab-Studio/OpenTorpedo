  - Fixed compile error on Windows, missing header include.

======= OpenTorpedo-1.4 ==================

  - Added new mission, provided by David Luckie.

====== OpenTorpedo-1.3 ===================

  - Added unistd.h and corrected DrawPixel declaration
    to fix compile/build errors.

  - Removed un-needed -k command line option. It
    was buggy and causing compiler warnings.


========= OpenTorpedo-1.2 Jun 3, 2012 ===========

  - Applied makefile patch from Vincent.

  - We no longer create font and largeont files in
    the directory "./data/" OpenTorpedo used to try to
    save our fonts in case the font files were missing,
    but this is no longer required and is probably
    improper behaviour. This fix closes Debian bug
    #675744.
    Thanks to Guillem for pointing out the error.



========== OpenTorpedo-1.1 Nov 7, 2011 ============

    should not need it.

======== OpenTorpedo-1.0 Oct 22, 2011 ============

  - Game now recognizes OPTDIR variable, for when OpenTorpedo
    is installed in /opt/OpenTorpedo/

    Patch provided by Vincent.

  - Added optinstall option for Makefile, installs
    OpenTorpedo under /opt/OpenTorpedo

    Files and updates provided by Vincent on behave of 
    the Debian project.

    X and S respectively.

  - Radar now gives us the location, but not a firm
    contact on surface vessels. Prevents "cheating'
    when on recon missions.

  - Ship type is now included in target information.

    and wrapped up in ifdefs.

  - Converted snprintf calls to sprintf for WIN32

  - Converted fabs() calls to abs() in radar.cpp for the WIN32 platform.

  - Dependency unistd.h removed from main.cpp

  - Added thermal layers to listening function Can_Hear().

  - Ships in a convoy now react when one of them is hit.
    Merchants scatter.

  - Moved update functions out of timer function to avoid
    overlap if too much is going on. Instead timer function now
    sets a flag to let us know we should update.
    This should fix the X11 crashes.

  - Torpedoes must be at the proper depth to strike a target.
