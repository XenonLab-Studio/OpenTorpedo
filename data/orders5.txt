Mission 6
We are planning an assault on the enemy's harbour. You
are ordered to sneak into the harbour and locate
the enemy's surface ships. Pay special attention to
the Nimitz class aircraft carrier. We need some close-up
data of that carrier. Or send it to the bottom.  
Watch your tail, there may    submarines in the area.
