Add tutorial

Add new mood, Hunt, which will cause AI to actively
search for submarines, including the use of active sonar.

Add waypoints?
Add map page item, zoom factor.
Helicopters should check out torpedoes being fired.

More short-cut keys for changing course, speed and depth.

Make interface scale.
The result of that command was:

Couldn't set video mode...
OpenTorpedo requires 1024x768 @ 16 bpp
No video mode large enough for 1024x768

I think my screen is 1024x600, but I use devices with smaller screens sometimes.
